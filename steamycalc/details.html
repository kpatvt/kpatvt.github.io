				<h1>SteamyCalc</h1>

					<p>Developed by <a href="mailto:kpatvt@gmail.com">Kiran Pashikanti &lt;kpatvt@gmail.com&gt;</a></p>

				<h2>Usage</h2>
				<p>
				Simply provide two conditions (quality, temperature, pressure, enthalpy, entropy) and remaining thermodynamic properties will be calculated.
                If there is any interest for other thermodynamic pairs (internal energy, etc.), those can probably be implemented upon request.	</p>

				<p>SteamyCalc is a full implementation of the IAPWS/IFC-97 Water and Steam tables written completely in JS and HTML.</p>
